# FrontEnd-VMproject

This repository is just for the front end.

If you have any problems with displaying any pages then erase the link from " window.location = 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/studentview.html' " and open student view in live server and the link the you get from there then copy and paste it in window.location. 

I like to try with different link like google,w3school or something like that to check if the code is correct.
