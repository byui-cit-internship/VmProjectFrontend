# FrontEnd-VMproject

This repository is just for the front end.
Everything is working properly. The CSS has been improve and now it's easier to read and navigate around. We still need to add the sign out buttons to create a better website. 

Things that need to be finish:
- Work on the canvas token tooltip in addClass.html
- Error catching 

Git commands:
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
