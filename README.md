# FrontEnd-VMproject

This repository is just for the front end.
Everything is working properly. The new step is going to connect the Canvas api with the front-end so then we can have the students info so when adding the virtual machine code is going to be easy to connect each functionality. The CSS has been improve and now it's easier to read and navigate around. We still need to add the sign out buttons to create a better website. 

I have added new functions. They are not completely done. It's what I'm working on this week. I have created a new page and now I have done the html for the form and now I need to add a dropdown menu for the semesters. 

Git commands:
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
