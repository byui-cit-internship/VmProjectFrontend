# FrontEnd-VMproject

This repository is just for the front end.

If you have any problems with displaying any pages then erase the link from " window.location = 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/studentview.html' " and open student view in live server and the link the you get from there then copy and paste it in window.location. 

I'm updating the repository slowly but making sure that every update is working fine. Next step is adding an avatar/user that can show the avatar and show the student/faculty's name and I-number. 

The pages are redirecting properly. The issue that I need to work on is to delay the directing process so the user has time to choose which email to use.
