# FrontEnd-VMproject

This repository is just for the front end.
Everything is working properly. The CSS has been improve and now it's easier to read and navigate around. We still need to add the sign out buttons to create a better website. 

- I have created another branch. In the main branch , we are using URL storage the token. In the sessionStorage branch, we are using sessionStorage to storage the token to add extra security to the website. 

 
Git commands:
git pull
git add .
