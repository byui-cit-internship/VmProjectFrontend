# FrontEnd-VMproject

This repository is just for the front end.
Everything is working properly. The new step is going to connect the Canvas api with the front-end so then we can have the students info so when adding the virtual machine code is going to be easy to connect each functionality. The CSS has been improve and now it's easier to read and navigate around. We still need to add the sign out buttons to create a better website. 

- I have added some code but it needs more work on it.
