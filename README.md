# FrontEnd-VMproject

This repository is just for the front end.
Everything is working properly. The new step is going to connect the Canvas api with the front-end so then we can have the students info so when adding the virtual machine code is going to be easy to connect each functionality. The CSS has been improve and now it's easier to read and navigate around. We still need to add the sign out buttons to create a better website. 

- I'm currently making another page to set up the virtual machines
- I have to add more details in the setup page and make it more proficient
